### Hi / PÃ«rshÃ«ndetje / Hola ðŸ‘‹

My name is Corey. I'm an experienced full stack developer. Most recently I ran the engineering team at [@clearsummit](https://github.com/clearsummit), where we built a range of applications using Django, React and React Native. 

Currently I work as Senior Full Stack Engineer at @venusprotocol where I work on everything from the frontend, subgraphs, infrastucture, and smart contracts.

I enjoy collaborating and hacking on side projects. Lately I've been digging deeper into web3 governance, wallets, and tooling.
